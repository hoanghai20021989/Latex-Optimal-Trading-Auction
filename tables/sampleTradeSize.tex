  \caption{Sample allocation between auction's block trade and the continuous trading strategy's size, using data from stock ACGL in October 2019, trading 5 percents of average trading volume of the first half of trading day. Compared to a pure TWAP trading stategy, the optimal stategy allocates 61.19 percents of the total position to be executed during the auction phase. The cost of trading in the auction phase accounts for 53.00 percents of the total cost of the strategy, while reducing 62.26 percents of total cost compared to a pure TWAP strategy, from 8.90 bps per share to 3.36 bps per share.}
