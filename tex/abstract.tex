\begin{abstract}
    We analyze the price impact of trading in a mixed auction market, in which the exchange employs both call auction and continuous auction. Based on a multiplayer game settings between a market maker and multiple liquidity takers, we derive a market impact model which characterizes both instantaneous and temporary price impact. The unified model shows how price discovery and market impact transit from the call auction to the continuous auction. From the market impact framework, an optimal trading strategy is derived with closed-form solution to execute a large order utilizing both auctions. By incorporating the risk-aversion of the principal agent, we show the volatility dampening effect when incorporating the call auction in the execution strategy. The optimal trading strategy is numerically demonstrated with the cost efficiency of trading in both auctions.
