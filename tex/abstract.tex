\begin{abstract}
    We analyze the price impact of trading in a mixed auction market, in which the exchange employs both call auction and continuous auction. Based on a multiplayer game settings between a market maker and one or more liquidity takers, we derive a market impact model which characterizes both instantaneous and temporary price impact. The unified model shows how price discovery and market impact transit from the call auction to the continuous auction. {\color{red}From the market impact framework, we derive an optimal trading strategy with closed-form solution to execute a large order utilizing both auctions. Furthermore, we incorporate the risk-aversion of the principal agent, showing the volatility dampening effect of incorporating the call auction in the execution strategy. Lastly,} The optimal trading strategy is numerically demonstrated with the cost efficiency of trading in both auctions compared to alternative only in the continuous trading auction.
